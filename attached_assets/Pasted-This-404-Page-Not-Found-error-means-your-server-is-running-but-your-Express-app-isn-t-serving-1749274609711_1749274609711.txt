This **404 Page Not Found** error means your server is running, but **your Express app isn’t serving a homepage or static files**—it’s only handling API routes like `/api/bookings`.

---

### Why it happens

* You have API routes (e.g., `/api/bookings`, `/api/barbers`) set up, but you **don’t have a front-end build** (like React/Vite) being served, or
* The static middleware (e.g., `serveStatic(app)`) isn’t finding your built front-end files, or
* You haven’t added a default route (`/`) that serves a real page.

---

### **How to fix it (pick what fits your setup):**

#### **A. If you have a React/Vite front-end:**

1. **Make sure you’ve run your build:**

   * From your project’s root, run:

     ```bash
     npm run build
     ```
   * This should create a `dist/` or `build/` folder with your static front-end.

2. **Check your static serving code:**
   In your server code (e.g. `serveStatic(app)`), make sure it’s actually serving from the right folder:

   ```js
   import path from "path";
   app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, "../dist")));
   // or wherever your front-end build files live
   ```

3. **Catch-all route for client-side routing:**

   ```js
   app.get("*", (req, res) => {
     res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, "../dist/index.html"));
   });
   ```

   (Update the path if your build folder is named differently.)

#### **B. If you only have the API (no UI yet):**

* That’s normal!
* You’ll get 404 on `/`, but your API endpoints (like `/api/bookings`) should work.

---

#### **C. Testing the API**

Try visiting:

```
https://barber-booker-boweazy123.replit.app/api/bookings
```

If you see JSON, your backend is working.

---

#### **D. If you want to display a landing page for `/`:**

Add this to your server code:

```js
app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.send("<h1>SmartFlowSystems API is running!</h1><p>Booking endpoints are at /api/*</p>");
});
```

---

### **Summary**

* **404 on `/`** just means no front-end or homepage is being served.
* Your API is live—check with `/api/bookings` or similar.
* To serve your UI, make sure to build it, serve it statically, and set a catch-all route.

Let me know if you want a step-by-step for integrating your React/Vite front-end, or if you’re just testing API endpoints for now!
